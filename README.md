We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.

### Course Description
 Overview of basic concepts and issues in biology including: biochemistry, the cellular basis of life, metabolism, and genetics. Course has a strong emphasis on the process of scientific inquiry using critical thinking and communication abilities. Course is primarily intended for pre-Healthcare students. Required for Nursing DTA-MRP.  Students may not receive credit for both BIOL 160 and BIOL 100.  [NS, SE]

#### Objectives
Successful completion of BIOL 160 fulfills 5 credits of the laboratory science distribution requirement for an Associates of Arts degree, fulfills the General/Cellular Biology requirement for the Nursing DTA-MRP, and also fulfills the prerequisite for BIOL 241 Human Anatomy and Physiology I.

#### Natural Science Program-Level Outcomes (PLOs)
All students who earn an Associate in Arts or an Associate in Science degree from Clark College are expected to be scientifically literate.  

In order to ensure this literacy, students successfully completing any Clark College Science course are expected to demonstrate the ability to:
 - Apply fundamental principles and relationships from the Natural Sciences to solve problems.
 - Apply scientific methodologies to develop and answer questions about the natural world.
 - Acquire scientific information from appropriate sources to analyze issues, claims or situations.
 - Evaluate claims about the natural world using scientific methodology.

#### BIOL 160 Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

The following table outlines connections between the Natural Science Program-Level Outcomes, the BIOL 160 Course-Level Outcomes, and specific concepts and activities in BIOL 160.  The table also shows the exams and assignments that will be used to assess proficiency for these various Outcomes.

|Natural Science PLOs|BIOL 160 CLOs|Assessment|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Apply fundamental principles and relationships from the Natural Sciences to solve problems|Apply basic biology principles including biochemistry, cells structure and function, metabolism, and genetics|Exams; Lab Practical Exams|
|Apply scientific methodologies to develop and answer questions about the natural world|Perform laboratory observation and experimentation/Draw conclusions about scientific principles based on practice of scientific methodologies|Lab Reports; Lab Practical Exams;|
|Acquire scientific information from appropriate sources to analyze issues, claims or situations|Evaluate the reliability of scientific information using appropriate literature research strategies|Biomedical Issues Research Project|
|Evaluate claims about the natural world using scientific methodology|Apply scientific methods of evidence-based hypothesis-testing to evaluate biological claims|Lab Reports; Biomedical Issues Research Project|

### Lab information
Please note that the lab and conference are NOT separate entities from the lecture. One final grade is given for entirety of class and lab assignments.

Labs focus on hands-on learning of key concepts; some labs will be outdoors or in the greenhouse, but the majority will take place in the classroom designated for labs.

Conferences will be used to introduce/review labs, take lecture tests and lab quizzes, and participate in additional activities and small group discussions. It is my hope that you will feel comfortable in the small group setting of lab and conference to participate in interactive group discussion and share your opinions, ideas and thoughts with your fellow lab-mates. Through collaboration you will come to a more full understanding of your place in the environment and what role you can play in a sustainable future.

#### Expectations

Science doesn't come naturally to most people. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This means that you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

Your effort outside of class will be reflected in the quality of work you do and result in a corresponding grade. In other words, do not expect an “A” grade when you are not putting in the time/effort outside of the classroom to achieve “A” work.

##### Specific student responsibilities
1.	You are responsible for knowing the due dates of assignments.
2. If you miss lab, you are responsible for obtaining copies of handouts from other students. Handouts will not be brought to class a second time for those students who missed class.
3. You are responsible for knowing WHERE the lab is meeting on any particular day.4.	You are responsible for knowing how you are doing in class. All points are cumulative. I'll often be collecting graded documents back after distributing them (quizzes, exams, etc.), so it may not be a bad idea to record your scores somewhere consistent to keep track. Instructors make grading mistakes, so it will benefit you to keep your own backup records.

*As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document, the course schedule, or referring to announcements made online. **As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus" or "see announcements".**

### Course policies

#### Attendance

Per university policy, attendance during the first week of class is mandatory. If you are absent during the first week and do not contact me, you will be dropped from the class. Attendance during the remainder of the term is critical to your success in this course. I will be tracking attendance informally with Socrative. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to get copies of any handouts from another student or from Canvas. Please do not schedule routine doctor or dental appointments during class time.  You are expected to be on time for the start of lectures and  laboratories, as I will begin classes promptly at the designated time. It is also helpful to sit towards the front of the lecture room, as students who sit in the back few rows of seats are more easily distracted. The exams will focus on material covered in lecture, and the answers to the exam questions may not be available directly from the textbook.

**Attendance at the laboratory section is mandatory**! Students who miss a lab or conference may not be able to make up the assignment, and as a result will lose the points for that assignment.  If you are absent, contact me as soon as possible to determine if a make-up session will be possible. If you know ahead of time that you may miss a lab, you may contact the instructor (at least one day ahead of time) of another lab to see if it is possible to attend their lab for that week. Each student may do this one time only during the quarter.

#### Class Preparation

Success in this course depends not only on attendance, but also on effort. Many of the concepts that we will discuss tend to be unfamiliar to students, and much of the vocabulary will likely also be new. In order to make the most of class time, read over the assigned chapters or sections BEFORE the class and then re-read them more carefully DIRECTLY AFTER the class in which they are discussed. Waiting until right before a test to read the text is highly ineffective. Throughout the quarter, there will be in-class group activities and I will also be calling on students for responses to questions.

#### Study Suggestions

In my experience, most introductory-level science classes are challenging because they introduce new terminology and concepts. It will be important to use study time wisely. Here is a list of suggestions:
- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.
- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during conference, lecture, or ask another student while you're studying.
- Use the objectives at the beginning of each chapter AND the questions at the end of the chapter as a study guide TODO true?. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in the textbook, I will make you aware of that.
- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.

#### Late/Missed Exams or Assignments
Students who must miss a scheduled exam will not be allowed to take a make-up exam.  Instead, they will count this exam as their lowest score to be dropped.  Late work will not be accepted and will not be graded unless the lateness was due to a documented illness.

#### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is required at all times. I have a ZERO tolerance policy for cheating. Anyone caught cheating will receive an “F” for the assignment and will likely be dropped from the course with a failing grade. If the cheating is discovered after the last drop date, the student receives an “F”. In addition, the student may be referred to the Office of the Vice President for further disciplinary action.

Cheating takes many forms. If you are not clear on what constitutes cheating (plagiarism, etc.), just ask me. Some quick examples of academic dishonesty include misrepresenting another student‘s work as your own or saying that you performed community service that you didn't.

#### Classroom Behavior

Modern technology is amazing, and in many instances it can be a tremendous learning asset. I'm not going to stop you from having or using these resources in class because you are an adult, and indeed will often leverage them to enhance your learning experience. However, sometimes the myriad temptations provided by having a phone, tablet, or laptop in front of you can compete with the course content for your attention.

There are several studies that demonstrate a dramatic decrease of retention when a learner tries to multi-task, so please be aware of this and be warned that YOU ARE NOT MIRACULOUSLY IMMUNE TO THIS EFFECT.
If you are honest with yourself and find the temptation too great, I strongly recommend taking notes by hand.
A respectful environment will be maintained at all times. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct online so you understand the student rights and responsibilities.

#### Course Withdrawal

Students may drop a class and receive a “W” grade until the end of the 8th week of classes. After that, you will not be allowed to drop a class unless you get permission from the Dean. If you stop coming to class without officially withdrawing you will receive an “F”. Although you will not need my signature to drop this course, please email me to let me know if you have withdrawn as a courtesy.

### Graded items and grading scale

*Please note that the weights and point distributions outlined below are subject to slight change. If the points values of anything change from what is laid out below, this syllabus will be updated, and I'll post an announcement about it.

TODO

|Graded Component|Details|Point value|
|:---:|:---:|:------:|
|Lecture Exams|There will be 3 Lecuture Exams each worth 100 points during the quarter. The lowest Exam score will be dropped. Exams 2 and 3 will cover only the material since the previous Exam (i.e. they will not be comprehensive). These tests may also include material from the lab(s) that have been completed during the same time interval.  The test format will consist of multiple-choice questions. SCANTRON answer forms will be used, meaning you will need to bring a number 2 pencil with an eraser to each test.  The test will begin promptly at the start of class, so be on time.  If you are late, you will only have the remaining portion of the time to complete the test and will only be allowed to start the exam if no one has finished.|200|
|Lab Practical Exams|There will be two lab practical exams that will test your knowledge of concepts in cell biology as well as practical application of lab-based skills. Lab Practical Exams require the setup of lab equipment and supplies (possibly including living organisms).  Thus, **Lab Practical Exams must be taken at their scheduled times**.  (2 practical exams @ 100 points each = 200 points)|200|
|Lab Modules|Throughout the quarter, we will have TODO 12 laboratory modules.  You will work with partners to complete the written portions of the lab report.  Ten points will be awarded satisfactory completion of each lab module.  Your lowest lab module score will be dropped. (11 lab modules @ 10 points each = 110 points)|110|
|Final Exam|The final exam will be given finals week. It is a comprehensive test, covering topics from all quarter. It is a multiple choice test.|150|
|Research Project|Working in teams of 3-5 students, you will research, analyze, and report on the validity of the various perspectives surrounding a contemporary biomedical issue. Your group will submit a research poster describing this research and analysis.  (Team Contract and 3 Team Evaluations @ 5 points each + Final Team Project @ 100 points = 120 points)|120|
|**Total**||780|

Grading Scale: Your grade will be figured objectively, based on the points you earn throughout the quarter as a percentage of the highest point total.  This allows you to easily track your grade as the quarter progresses so there won’t be any surprises at the end. Changes to assignment, quiz, and exam grades will be made if there has been a mathematical error.  Re-grades will NOT be performed on a question-by-question basis.  If you feel that the answer you selected is better than the answer on the answer key and you submit your exam for re-grading, the ENTIRE EXAM will be re-graded (not just that one question).

After final grades have been formulated, there will be no modifications (except to correct grading mistakes due to mathematical error).  In an effort to standardize the course across various instructors, it is departmental policy to offer no extra credit opportunities for Biology 160. If you are having trouble with the course and fear you will not achieve an adequate grade, see your instructor early, get help, and do so regularly throughout the term.

#### Grading Scale

 Grades are based on a percentage of the total cumulative points. TODO Total lecture points + Total lab points will result in the final grade (see table above).

|Letter Grade|Corresponding Percentage Range|
|:---:|:---:||A|92-100%||B+|88-89%|
|B|82-87%|
|B-|80-81%|
|C+|77-79%|
|C|70-76%|
|D|60-69%|
|F|<59.9%|
