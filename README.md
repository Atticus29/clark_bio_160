#### Socrative

- We will take advantage of a student response system called [Socrative](https://b.socrative.com/login/student/). The Room Name is **FISHER2070**. We will be using this tool to assess your (collective and personal) comprehension of topics in real time in the classroom. I'll be designing questions that I'll ask during lecture and lab and posting them to the room on Socrative. You'll be able to answer these questions from any browser or from the [ios or Android app](https://www.socrative.com/apps.html) downloaded onto your phone or tablet. If you can, please bring such a device to class every day. **If you are unable to do this, please let me know as soon as possible**.

### Course Description
 Overview of basic concepts and issues in biology including: biochemistry, the cellular basis of life, metabolism, and genetics. Course has a strong emphasis on the process of scientific inquiry using critical thinking and communication abilities. Course is primarily intended for pre-Healthcare students. Required for Nursing DTA-MRP.  Students may not receive credit for both BIOL 160 and BIOL 100.  [NS, SE]

#### Objectives
Successful completion of BIOL 160 fulfills 5 credits of the laboratory science distribution requirement for an Associates of Arts degree, fulfills the General/Cellular Biology requirement for the Nursing DTA-MRP, and also fulfills the prerequisite for BIOL 241 Human Anatomy and Physiology I.

#### Natural Science Program-Level Outcomes (PLOs)
All students who earn an Associate in Arts or an Associate in Science degree from Clark College are expected to be scientifically literate.  

In order to ensure this literacy, students successfully completing any Clark College Science course are expected to demonstrate the ability to:
 - Apply fundamental principles and relationships from the Natural Sciences to solve problems.
 - Apply scientific methodologies to develop and answer questions about the natural world.
 - Acquire scientific information from appropriate sources to analyze issues, claims or situations.
 - Evaluate claims about the natural world using scientific methodology.

#### BIOL 160 Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs)

The following table outlines connections between the Natural Science Program-Level Outcomes, the BIOL 160 Course-Level Outcomes, and specific concepts and activities in BIOL 160.  The table also shows the exams and assignments that will be used to assess proficiency for these various Outcomes.

|Natural Science PLOs|BIOL 160 CLOs|Assessment|

### Lab information
Please note that the lab and conference are NOT separate entities from the lecture. One final grade is given for entirety of class and lab assignments.

Labs focus on hands-on learning of key concepts; some labs will be outdoors or in the greenhouse, but the majority will take place in the classroom designated for labs.

Conferences will be used to introduce/review labs, take lecture tests and lab quizzes, and participate in additional activities and small group discussions. It is my hope that you will feel comfortable in the small group setting of lab and conference to participate in interactive group discussion and share your opinions, ideas and thoughts with your fellow lab-mates. Through collaboration you will come to a more full understanding of your place in the environment and what role you can play in a sustainable future.

#### Expectations

Science doesn't come naturally to most people. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This means that you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

Your effort outside of class will be reflected in the quality of work you do and result in a corresponding grade. In other words, do not expect an “A” grade when you are not putting in the time/effort outside of the classroom to achieve “A” work.

##### Specific student responsibilities
1.	You are responsible for knowing the due dates of assignments.
2. If you miss lab, you are responsible for obtaining copies of handouts from other students. Handouts will not be brought to class a second time for those students who missed class.
3. You are responsible for knowing WHERE the lab is meeting on any particular day.4.	You are responsible for knowing how you are doing in class. All points are cumulative. I'll often be collecting graded documents back after distributing them (quizzes, exams, etc.), so it may not be a bad idea to record your scores somewhere consistent to keep track. Instructors make grading mistakes, so it will benefit you to keep your own backup records.

*As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document, the course schedule, or referring to announcements made online. **As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus" or "see announcements".**

### Course policies

1. Attendance

	Per university policy, attendance during the first week of class is mandatory. If you are absent during the first week and do not contact me, you will be dropped from the class. Attendance during the remainder of the term is critical to your success in this course. I will be tracking attendance with Socrative, and it will contribute to your participation grade (see below). The exams will focus on material covered in lecture, and the answers to the exam questions may not be available directly from the textbook.

	If you are unable to attend a class later in the quarter, I will not have notes available for you; please get in touch with a classmate (or better yet, ask one in advance to take notes for you if you know in advance that you won't be there).
2.	Class Preparation

	Success in this course depends not only on attendance, but also on effort. Many of the concepts that we will discuss tend to be unfamiliar to students, and much of the vocabulary will likely also be new. In order to make the most of class time, read over the assigned chapters or sections BEFORE the class and then re-read them more carefully DIRECTLY AFTER the class in which they are discussed. Waiting until right before a test to read the text is highly ineffective. Throughout the quarter, there will be in-class group activities and I will also be calling on students for responses to questions. Your interaction on these fronts will contribute to your participation grade.

3.	Study Suggestions

	In my experience, most introductory-level science classes are challenging because they introduce new terminology and concepts. It will be important to use study time wisely. Here is a list of suggestions:
	- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.	- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during conference, lecture, or ask another student while you're studying.	- Use the objectives at the beginning of each chapter AND the “Testing Your Comprehension questions” at the end of the chapter as a study guide. These review questions will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in the textbook, I will make you aware of that.	- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.

4. Academic Honesty

	Academic honesty is required at all times. I have a ZERO tolerance policy for cheating. Anyone caught cheating will receive an “F” for the assignment and will likely be dropped from the course with a failing grade. If the cheating is discovered after the last drop date, the student receives an “F”. In addition, the student may be referred to the Office of the Vice President for further disciplinary action.

	Cheating takes many forms. If you are not clear on what constitutes cheating (plagiarism, etc.), just ask me. Some quick examples of academic dishonesty include misrepresenting another student‘s work as your own or saying that you performed community service that you didn't.5. Classroom Behavior

	Modern technology is amazing, and in many instances it can be a tremendous learning asset. I'm not going to stop you from having or using these resources in class because you are an adult, and indeed will often leverage them to enhance your learning experience. However, sometimes the myriad temptations provided by having a phone, tablet, or laptop in front of you can compete with the course content for your attention.

	There are several studies that demonstrate a dramatic decrease of retention when a learner tries to multi-task, so please be aware of this and be warned that YOU ARE NOT MIRACULOUSLY IMMUNE TO THIS EFFECT.
	If you are honest with yourself and find the temptation too great, I strongly recommend taking notes by hand.
	A respectful environment will be maintained at all times. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct online so you understand the student rights and responsibilities.
6. Course Withdrawal

	Students may drop a class and receive a “W” grade until the end of the 8th week of classes. After that, you will not be allowed to drop a class unless you get permission from the Dean. If you stop coming to class without officially withdrawing you will receive an “F”. Although you will not need my signature to drop this course, please email me to let me know if you have withdrawn as a courtesy.7. Late Assignment Policy

	Assignments worth over 10 points will be accepted with point deductions up to 1 week after the due date with a point penalty. Each weekday, there will be a 10% point deduction, up to a 50% deduction after 5 weekdays. Assignments more than 1 week late (5 weekdays) will NOT be accepted. Personal action journals, eco-footprints, and other items that are to be posted on online Forums or discussion boards will not be accepted late.
8. Missed Tests

	There will be no make-up tests. This includes family emergencies, sicknesses, etc. Because of this stringent policy, the lowest test score will automatically be dropped.	### Graded items and grading scale

*Please note that the weights and point distributions outlined below are subject to slight change. If the points values of anything change from what is laid out below, this syllabus will be updated, and I'll post an announcement about it.

|Graded Component|Details|Contribution (raw points)|Contribution (% of final grade)|

|Community Service|You will be responsible for coming up with a detailed plan for environmental community service by the end of week 4. During the quarter, you will be responsible for at least 8 hours of verified work. Document your work and answer the questions on the form in a single spaced typed one-two page final report. Final forms are due to be uploaded to our course website by the last lecture period. I am highly recommending work at the Clark College Native Plant Propagation Center located at the college greenhouse. I will provide a list with one or two other options as well. If you want to volunteer with any other environmental organization for this credit, you MUST get my approval BEFORE volunteering in order to receive credit. All forms will be posted on our course website.|100|13.8%|
|Tests|Tests will not be comprehensive. They will cover the chapters and information from the labs that week. Tests will be multiple choice, matching, true/false, and short answer. Please bring a #2 pencil and an eraser. Your lowest test score will be dropped. Tests will be given in conference unless otherwise noted. NO make-up tests since I drop a score anyway.|best four of five tests @ 50 points each = 200|27.6%|
