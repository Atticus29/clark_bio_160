### Lab information
Please note that the lab and conference are NOT separate entities from the lecture. One final grade is given for entirety of class and lab assignments.

Labs focus on hands-on learning of key concepts; some labs will be outdoors or in the greenhouse, but the majority will take place in the classroom designated for labs.

Conferences will be used to introduce/review labs, take lecture tests and lab quizzes, and participate in additional activities and small group discussions. It is my hope that you will feel comfortable in the small group setting of lab and conference to participate in interactive group discussion and share your opinions, ideas and thoughts with your fellow lab-mates. Through collaboration you will come to a more full understanding of your place in the environment and what role you can play in a sustainable future.

#### Expectations

Science doesn't come naturally to most people. If this is your first collegiate science course, you might be surprised at the amount of time required to be successful. Typically for every 1 hour a student is in a classroom lecture, they should be putting in 3 hours of homework on assignments, reading, and study time. This means that you should **carve out about 9 hours a week** to devote to reading, reviewing and completing assignments outside of the time spent with me in the classroom. This can vary for each student depending on how effectively you use your time and how well you comprehend the reading, but it should give you an idea of a typical college course expectation.

Your effort outside of class will be reflected in the quality of work you do and result in a corresponding grade. In other words, do not expect an “A” grade when you are not putting in the time/effort outside of the classroom to achieve “A” work.

#### Specific student responsibilities

1.	You are responsible for knowing the due dates of assignments.
2. If you miss lab, you are responsible for obtaining copies of handouts from other students. Handouts will not be brought to class a second time for those students who missed class.
3. You are responsible for knowing WHERE the lab is meeting on any particular day.4.	You are responsible for knowing how you are doing in class. All points are cumulative. I'll often be collecting graded documents back after distributing them (quizzes, exams, etc.), so it may not be a bad idea to record your scores somewhere consistent to keep track. Instructors make grading mistakes, so it will benefit you to keep your own backup records.

As you might imagine, we instructors get a ton of emails containing questions that could easily be answered by looking at this document, the course schedule, or referring to announcements made online. As a courtesy to me, please make sure that these information sources have been checked before you email me with logistical questions. I reserve the right to reply with, "see syllabus" or "see announcements".

### Graded items and grading scale

Your grade will be based on the percentage score you earn throughout the quarter.  This is calculated as follows:  (Points Earned x 100) ÷ 555 Points Possible.

|Graded Component|Details|Total Point Value|
|:---:|:---:|:------:|
|Study Journals|There will be 5 study journal assignments.  These are meant to have you think about the processes of learning. 5 @ 5 pts. each| 25 pts.|
|Active Learning Assignments|Over the course, we will have several assignments that ask you to apply and connect concepts together. They are collectively worth 30 points.|30 pts.|
|Lecture Tests|There will be 3 tests (see Schedule), each worth 75 points. The format will consist of multiple-choice questions and possibly short answer questions. The first two tests will take place in class; they'll be 1-1.5 hours, and I'll tell you how long you have in advance of the test. SCANTRON answer forms will be provided.  You will need to bring a number 2 pencil with an eraser to each of the in-class tests. The third test will be a 48-hour take-home test, and it will likely be formatted similarly. 3 @ 75 pts. each, lowest dropped|150 pts.|
|Lab Modules|In lab, we will work on lab modules that ask you to perform hands on activities or web investigations.  This will help to approach the biological concepts in a more applied way than can be obtained from the reading the textbook. 10 @ 10 pts. each|100 pts.|
|Lab Practicals|There will be two lab practical exams that will test your knowledge of cell biology and your ability to apply lab-based skills. Lab Practical Exams require the setup of lab equipment and supplies (possibly including living organisms).  Thus, Lab Practical Exams must be taken at their scheduled times (see Schedule). 2 @ 50 pts. each|100 pts.|
|Final Exam|The final exam will occur on the last day of the term.  It will cover all topics covered during the term (both lecture and lab).  The final exam will be a combination of multiple choice and short answer questions. Scantron forms will be provided.  You will need a number 2 pencil with eraser.  The final exam score will count in your final grade (it will not be dropped).  Since the final exam is cumulative, if your final exam percentage score is higher than the total percentage from all your other work, your final exam percentage will be used as your final class percentage.  That is, even if you fail everything else in class, if you earn an “A” on the final exam, you’ll end up with an “A” in the class.|150 pts.|
|**Total**||555|

*Please note that the weights and point distributions outlined below are subject to slight change. If the points values of anything change from what is laid out below, this syllabus will be updated, and I'll post an announcement about it.*

Grading Scale: Your grade will be figured objectively, based on the points you earn throughout the quarter as a percentage of the highest point total.  This allows you to easily track your grade as the quarter progresses so there won’t be any surprises at the end. Changes to assignment, quiz, and exam grades will be made if there has been a mathematical error.  Re-grades will NOT be performed on a question-by-question basis.  If you feel that the answer you selected is better than the answer on the answer key and you submit your exam for re-grading, the ENTIRE EXAM will be re-graded (not just that one question).

After final grades have been formulated, there will be no modifications (except to correct grading mistakes due to mathematical error).  In an effort to standardize the course across various instructors, it is departmental policy to offer no extra credit opportunities for Biology 160. If you are having trouble with the course and fear you will not achieve an adequate grade, see your instructor _early_, get help, and do so regularly throughout the term.That will give you time to learn in an authentic way (which is the goal of a college education!).

#### Grading Scale

 Grades are based on a percentage of the total cumulative points
. Total lecture points + Total lab points (= 555 points) will result in the final grade (see table above).

|Letter Grade|Corresponding Percentage Range|
|:---:|:---:|
|A|92-100%|
|A-|90-91.9%|
|B+|88-89.9%|
|B|82-87.9%|
|B-|80-81.9%|
|C+|77-79.9%|
|C|70-76.9%|
|D|60-69.9%|
|F|<59.9%|

### Course Policies

#### Attendance

I will be tracking attendance/participation informally with Socrative and reserve the right to use this information to push your final grade up to the next higher category or down to the next lower one. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to get copies of any handouts from another student or from Canvas. Please do not schedule routine doctor or dental appointments during class time.  You are expected to be on time for the start of lectures and  laboratories, as I will begin classes promptly at the designated time. It is also helpful to sit towards the front of the lecture room, as students who sit in the back few rows of seats are more easily distracted. The exams will focus on material covered in lecture, and the answers to the exam questions may not always be available directly from the textbook.

**Attendance at the laboratory section is mandatory**! If you know ahead of time that you may miss a lab, it may be possible to attend another lab session. Find another section of the Biology 160 lab that you can attend on the same week, and send an email both to that instructor and to me to see whether such a make-up is feasible that week. Each student may do this one time only during the quarter.

You'll notice that there is one open session for review and lab practical prep. If you missed a lab and/or were late to a lab, this is the perfect time to work on completing and turning in the lab modules for these labs.

I'll be accepting lab submissions up until the date of the final exam without penalty. Early and/or on-time submissions are much appreciated. **I won't accept lab prompt submissions after the date of the final exam**.


#### Class Preparation

Success in this course depends not only on attendance, but also on effort. Many of the concepts that we will discuss tend to be unfamiliar to students, and much of the vocabulary will likely also be new. In order to make the most of class time, read over the assigned chapters or sections BEFORE the class and then re-read them more carefully DIRECTLY AFTER the class in which they are discussed. Waiting until right before a test to read the text is highly ineffective. Throughout the quarter, there will be in-class group activities and I will also be calling on students for responses to questions.

#### Late/Missed Exams or Assignments
Students who must miss a scheduled lecture test will not be allowed to take a make-up.  Instead, they will count this lecture test as their lowest score to be dropped.  Acceptance of late work is at the instructor’s discretion and will typically only occur due to documented emergency. Late lab module submissions will be accepted without penalty.

#### Academic Honesty

Academic honesty is required at all times.  Incidences of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, plagiarism, cheating on class work, and fraudulent representation of student work product.  These practices are considered a violation of the [Code of Student Conduct](http://www.clark.edu/clark-and-community/about/policies-procedures/student_code.php).  Disciplinary action will result in a zero for the activity/assignment/test and may be taken as outlined in the Code of Student Conduct.

#### Classroom Behavior

Modern technology is amazing, and in many instances it can be a tremendous learning asset. I'm not going to stop you from having or using these resources in class because you are in a college class, and indeed will often leverage them to enhance your learning experience. However, sometimes the myriad temptations provided by having a phone, tablet, or laptop in front of you can compete with the course content for your attention.

There are several studies that demonstrate a dramatic decrease of retention when a learner tries to multi-task, so please be aware of this and be warned that YOU ARE NOT MIRACULOUSLY IMMUNE TO THIS EFFECT.

If you are honest with yourself and find the temptation too great, I strongly recommend putting the electronics aways and taking notes by hand.

A respectful environment will be maintained at all times. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct online so you understand the student rights and responsibilities.

#### Course Withdrawal

Students may drop a class and receive a “W” grade until the end of the 8th week of classes. After that, you will not be allowed to drop a class unless you get permission from the Dean. If you stop coming to class without officially withdrawing you will receive an “F”. Although you will not need my signature to drop this course, please email me to let me know if you have withdrawn as a courtesy.

#### ADA Accommodations
If you have emergency medical information which should be shared; or if you
require assistance in case the building should be evacuated; please make an appointment to see me as soon as possible during the office hours indicated in this syllabus. Any student with a disability who may require accommodation in order to fully participate in this class should contact the Disability Support Services Office 31 | Page at (360) 992-2314 or (360) 991-0901 (VP) or stop by GHL 137 or the Penguin Union Building (PUB) room 013.

### Laboratory Safety
No food or drinks are allowed in the lab.  Labs may involve pathogens (disease-causing organisms), and/or chemical and physical hazards.  Failure to follow appropriate lab precautions may result in your removal from the lab for that session.

### Non-discrimination Policy
Clark College affirms a commitment to freedom from discrimination for all members of the college community. The responsibility for, and the protection of, this commitment extends to students, faculty, administration, staff, contractors, and those who develop or participate in college programs. It encompasses every aspect of employment and every student and community activity. The college expressly prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, perceived or actual physical or mental disability, pregnancy, genetic information, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, creed, religion, honorably discharged veteran or military status, or use of a trained guide dog or service animal.

#### Title IX and Sexual Misconduct
Clark College’s sexual misconduct policy (WAC 132N-125-035(14)) strictly prohibits sexual harassment,
intimidation, and violence, including domestic and dating violence, and stalking. Anyone experiencing sexual
misconduct is encouraged to talk to someone about what happened so they can get the support needed, and
Clark College can respond appropriately. If you wish to speak confidentially about an incident of sexual
misconduct, please contact a counselor at the [Counseling and Health Center](http://www.clark.edu/campuslife/student-support/counseling/health_services/).
Any disclosure of such misconduct shared with a faculty or
staff member in person, via email, and/or in coursework requires that Clark College faculty and staff act as
“responsible employees” and share this information with the Title IX Coordinator, Maria Masson, Assistant
Director of Human Resources. Information regarding support, resources, and reporting options can be found
[online](http://www.clark.edu/clark-and-community/about/policies-procedures/title-IX/index.php)

### Study Suggestions

In my experience, most introductory-level science classes are challenging because they introduce new terminology and concepts. It will be important to use study time wisely. Here is a list of suggestions:
- Work hard during lectures. This work does not involve writing, word for word, everything that is said. Consider instead the strategy of taking sketchy notes during class, which frees up limited attention space for listening, participating, and thinking about the topics discussed. Following class, flesh out your notes, adding as much detail as possible. This forces a re-thinking of the discussion, putting the concepts in an order that makes sense to you.
- Make a list of questions as you study your notes and read the textbook. Ask these questions during conference, lecture, or ask another student while you're studying.
- Use the objectives associated with each chapter in the Learning Objectives module on Canvas AND the questions at the end of the chapter as a study guide. These resources will highlight what is most important to focus on in the text. If any of my objectives for a unit go beyond those mentioned in on Canvas, I will make you aware of that.
- Form study groups! Study groups can help everyone, whether you are doing well or are doing poorly. Use your study group to quiz each other and offer short teaching demos to each other on particular topics; you never truly appreciate what you know and don't know until you have to teach it to somebody else.
